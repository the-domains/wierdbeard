  Crown-of-thorns starfish are the zombies of the sea. They won't die even if
  you cut them in half. To kill one, you must dismember it completely-or inject
  it with poisonous (to them) bile salts. Instead of braaains, these zombies
  munch coral, and off the coast of Australia, infestations of the beasts are
  damaging the Great Barrier Reef at an alarming rate.
